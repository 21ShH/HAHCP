### Prerequisites

### Data Set


- O-Haze (45 pics)

### HAHCP

#### To make the operation more intuitive, we have divided the algorithm into two separate parts `hist.m` and `HAHCP.m`, but they can also be integrated into a single program. 


- `hist.m` calculates the image histogram and records the dominant gray level and its corresponding pixel count. 
 
- `HAHCP.m` implements the main algorithmic computations.
